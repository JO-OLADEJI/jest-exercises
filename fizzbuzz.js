// Write a function that takes in a number and returns one of the following:

// If the number is divisible by 3, return "Fizz".
// If the number is divisible by 5, return "Buzz".
// If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz".
// Otherwise, just return the number that was passed into the function.

const fizzBuzz = (number) => {
